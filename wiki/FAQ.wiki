==Can I change the UI of the notification?==

Yes. Currently there are built in themes that you can choose from. If you have any themes (any phone styles like a 3rd party rom, etc.) that you would like to see the notifications in, please contact me and I will do my best to create a theme in that style.

==The notification icon isn't removed when I dismiss or acknowledge the new message?==

This is likely because you have the system messaging app notifications still enabled or another apps notifications enabled for incoming messages. Unfortunately there is no way for Developer Apps to remove another apps notifications. Currently Droid Notify does not provide notifications in the status bar. It is being considered as an enhancement.

==The contact photo in the notification doesn't display the user's facebook photo even though it shows in the system contacts?==

Unfortunately the Facebook app doesn't allow Developer Apps to access the photos it imports into the phone.

==Is Google Voice integrated with Droid Notify?==

Unfortunately, the answer is no.

Google Voice is a private app and does not have an open API so currently there is no way to tap into it's SMS messages or other data that it uses. I will continue to monitor the app and look for any API's that will allow Droid Notify to communicate with it or it's data, but at this time it's not possible. The only solution is to enable the Google voice option to forward your Google Voice activity to you via SMS messages.
