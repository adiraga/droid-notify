==Can I change the UI of the notification?==

Yes. There are built in themes that you can choose from. If you have any themes (any phone styles like a 3rd party rom, etc.) that you would like to see the notifications in, please contact me and I will do my best to create a theme in that style.

==The notification icon isn't removed when I dismiss or acknowledge the new message, why?==

This is likely because you have the messaging app notifications still enabled (or another apps notifications enabled for the type of notification: Calendar app, etc.) Unfortunately, there is no way for developer apps to remove another applications notifications. 

Droid Notify supports its own Status Bar Notifications. If you enable this feature, make sure that you disable the notifications from the Messaging App, Calendar App and any other apps that Droid Notify supports.

==The contact photo in the notification doesn't display the user's Facebook photo even though it shows in the system contacts, why?==

Unfortunately the Facebook app doesn't allow Developer Apps to access the photos it imports into the phone.

==Is Google Voice integrated with Droid Notify?==

Unfortunately, the answer is no.

Google Voice is a private app and does not have an open API so currently there is no way to tap into its SMS messages or other data that it uses. I will continue to monitor the app and look for any API's that will allow Droid Notify to communicate with it or its data, but at this time it's not possible. The only solution is to enable the Google voice option to forward your Google Voice activity to you via SMS messages.

==Can Droid Notify be moved to the SD card?==

Unfortunately, the answer is no.

If the app is moved to the SD Card / External Storage, the functionality of the application will be impacted in a negative manor. This application uses alarms and phone state intent filters to function normally. When apps are moved to the SD Card, the phone state intent filters are not received and if the SD card is ever removed or unmounted, all alarms are cleared from the memory. These issues would be catastrophic in terms of the apps operation so the application must remain on the phones internal memory.

==Known Issues with Go SMS Pro & Droid Notify==

If you want to use GO SMS Pro, you must follow the steps below in order for Droid Notify to work with SMS/MMS notifications.

1) Uncheck/deselect the "Disable other message notifications" option in the GO SMS Pro settings/preferences (Settings->Advanced Tab->Receive Settings). If this option is checked/selected then Droid Notify may not work (i.e. SMS/MMS notifications may not be displayed).

2) Uncheck/deselect the "Enable Go SMS run persistently" option in the GO SMS Pro settings/preferences (Settings->Advanced Tab->Important Tips). If this option is checked/selected then Droid Notify may not work (i.e. SMS/MMS notifications may not be displayed).

==Known Issues with Pansi SMS & Droid Notify==

If you want to use Pansi SMS, you must follow the steps below in order for Droid Notify to work with SMS/MMS notifications.

1) Uncheck/deselect the "Disable other message notifications" option in the Pansi SMS settings/preferences. If this option is checked/selected then Droid Notify may not work (i.e. SMS/MMS notifications may not be displayed).

==Known Issues with Zlango Messaging & Droid Notify==

If you want to use Zlango Messaging, you must follow the steps below in order for Droid Notify to work with SMS/MMS notifications.

1) Uncheck/deselect the "Set as default messaging client" option in the Zlango Messaging settings/preferences. If this option is checked/selected then Droid Notify may not work (i.e. SMS/MMS notifications may not be displayed).

==Will email notifications be an added feature in Droid Notify?==

The answer is...it depends...(possibly).

At this time the Email content on Android phones is secure and 3rd party apps cannot read the phones emails. The only solution to this is to develop an email client which is out of the scope of this project.

I will look into the Gmail api and see if we can read Gmail email as an alternative.

K-9 and Kaiten email clients are now supported but you will need to have a K-9 mail client (K-9 Mail, Kaiten, etc.) on your phone for those notifications to work. 

==Will Droid Notify display calendar events by non Android calendars?==

The answer is...it depends.

Developer apps have the ability to read the Google Calendar that is build into the Android OS. If the calendar app syncs all the information to the Google Calendar, then Droid Notify will read the Google Calendar and notify you of the events. On the other hand if the calendar app keeps it's own calendar, then developer apps can't access that data and so Droid Notify won't notify you of the calendar events.

==I get status bar notifications but no popup, why?==

This issue is most likely due to the popup being blocked. Being in a phone call blocks the popup, but there is also an option to block the popup if you are composing a message in a messaging app. You can change this setting here (Settings->Notification Settings->SMS/MMS/Missed Call/Calendar Notifications, Etc.->Blocking Notification Options). Select the option "Show Notification". This will ensure that the popup is not blocked.

==Can I help translate this application?==

Yes! I would encourage anyone who speaks English and any other language to help translate this application. Currently, I am trying out a collaborative translation tool powered by Translations powered by [http://www.crowdin.net/ CrowdIn.Net]. Email me if you would like to help translate this application (droidnotify@gmail.com).
