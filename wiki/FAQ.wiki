==Can I change the UI of the notification?==

Yes. There are built in themes that you can choose from. If you have any themes (any phone styles like a 3rd party rom, etc.) that you would like to see the notifications in, please contact me and I will do my best to create a theme in that style.

==The notification icon isn't removed when I dismiss or acknowledge the new message?==

This is likely because you have the messaging app notifications still enabled (or another apps notifications enabled for the type of notification: Calendar app, etc.) Unfortunately, there is no way for developer apps to remove another apps notifications. 

Droid Notify supports its own Status Bar Notifications. If you enable this feature, make sure that you disable the notifications from the Messaging App, Calendar App and any other apps that Droid Notify supports.

==The contact photo in the notification doesn't display the user's Facebook photo even though it shows in the system contacts?==

Unfortunately the Facebook app doesn't allow Developer Apps to access the photos it imports into the phone.

==Is Google Voice integrated with Droid Notify?==

Unfortunately, the answer is no.

Google Voice is a private app and does not have an open API so currently there is no way to tap into its SMS messages or other data that it uses. I will continue to monitor the app and look for any API's that will allow Droid Notify to communicate with it or its data, but at this time it's not possible. The only solution is to enable the Google voice option to forward your Google Voice activity to you via SMS messages.

==Can Droid Notify be moved to the SD card?==

Unfortunately, the answer is no.

If the app is moved to the SD Card / External Storage, the functionality of the application will be impacted in a negative manor. This application uses alarms and phone state intent filters to function normally. When apps are moved to the SD Card, the phone state intent filters are not received and if the SD card is ever removed or unmounted, all alarms are cleared from the memory. These issues would be catastrophic in terms of the apps operation so the application must remain on the phones internal memory.

==Known Issues with Go SMS Pro & Droid Notify==

If you want to use GO SMS Pro, you must follow one of the two steps below in order for Droid Notify to work with SMS/MMS notifications. These steps will only work with Droid Notify Version 2.4 or greater.

1) Uncheck/deselect the "Disable other apps notifications" option in the GO SMS Pro settings/preferences. If this option is checked/selected then Droid Notify may not work (i.e. SMS/MMS notifications may not be displayed).

-OR-

2) If you still want SMS GO Pro to disable other apps notifications you will need to follow these simple instructions. Uninstall GO SMS Pro, install Droid Notify THEN install GO SMS Pro. Basically, GO SMS Pro MUST be installed AFTER Droid Notify.

==Will email notifications be an added feature in Droid Notify?==

Unfortunately, the answer is no.

Unfortunately, at this time the Email content on Android phones is secure and 3rd party apps cannot read the phones emails. The only solution to this is to develop an email client which is out of the scope of this project.

I will look into the Gmail api and see if we can read gmail email as an alternative.
