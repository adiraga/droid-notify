==Can I change the UI of the notification?==

I am currently working on a few different UI's for the notifications. I am not a graphic designer but I am more than willing to work with anyone who has a concept for a notification window. Please email me if you have any suggestions.

==The notification icon isn't removed when I dismiss or acknowledge the new message?==

This is likely because you have the system messaging app notifications still enabled or another apps notifications enabled for incoming messages. Unfortunately there is no way for Developer Apps to remove another apps notifications. Currently Droid Notify does not provide notifications in the status bar. It is being considered as an enhancement.
