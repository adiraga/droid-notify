==Can I change the UI of the notification?==

Yes. There are built in themes that you can choose from. If you have any themes (any phone styles like a 3rd party rom, etc.) that you would like to see the notifications in, please contact me and I will do my best to create a theme in that style.

==The notification icon isn't removed when I dismiss or acknowledge the new message, why?==

This is likely because you have the messaging app notifications still enabled (or another apps notifications enabled for the type of notification: Calendar app, etc.) Unfortunately, there is no way for developer apps to remove another applications notifications. 

Droid Notify supports its own Status Bar Notifications. If you enable this feature, make sure that you disable the notifications from the Messaging App, Calendar App and any other apps that Droid Notify supports.

==The contact photo in the notification doesn't display the user's Facebook photo even though it shows in the system contacts, why?==

Unfortunately the Facebook app doesn't allow Developer Apps to access the photos it imports into the phone.

==Is Google Voice integrated with Droid Notify?==

Unfortunately, the answer is no.

Google Voice is a private app and does not have an open API so currently there is no way to tap into its SMS messages or other data that it uses. I will continue to monitor the app and look for any API's that will allow Droid Notify to communicate with it or its data, but at this time it's not possible. The only solution is to enable the Google voice option to forward your Google Voice activity to you via SMS messages.

==Is !WhatsApp integrated with Droid Notify?==

Unfortunately, the answer is no.

!WhatsApp is a private app and does not have an open API so currently there is no way to tap into its SMS messages or other data that it uses. I will continue to monitor the app and look for any API's that will allow Droid Notify to communicate with it or its data, but at this time it's not possible.

==Can Droid Notify be moved to the SD card?==

Unfortunately, the answer is no.

If the app is moved to the SD Card / External Storage, the functionality of the application will be impacted in a negative manor. This application uses alarms and phone state intent filters to function normally. When apps are moved to the SD Card, the phone state intent filters are not received and if the SD card is ever removed or unmounted, all alarms are cleared from the memory. These issues would be catastrophic in terms of the apps operation so the application must remain on the phones internal memory.

==Known Issues with Go SMS Pro & Droid Notify==

If you want to use GO SMS Pro, you must follow the steps below in order for Droid Notify to work with SMS/MMS notifications.

1) Uncheck/deselect the "Disable other message notifications" option in the GO SMS Pro settings/preferences (Settings->Advanced Tab->Receive Settings). If this option is checked/selected then Droid Notify may not work (i.e. SMS/MMS notifications may not be displayed).

2) Uncheck/deselect the "Enable Go SMS run persistently" option in the GO SMS Pro settings/preferences (Settings->Advanced Tab->Important Tips). If this option is checked/selected then Droid Notify may not work (i.e. SMS/MMS notifications may not be displayed).

==Known Issues with Pansi SMS & Droid Notify==

If you want to use Pansi SMS, you must follow the steps below in order for Droid Notify to work with SMS/MMS notifications.

1) Uncheck/deselect the "Disable other message notifications" option in the Pansi SMS settings/preferences. If this option is checked/selected then Droid Notify may not work (i.e. SMS/MMS notifications may not be displayed).

==Known Issues with Zlango Messaging & Droid Notify==

If you want to use Zlango Messaging, you must follow the steps below in order for Droid Notify to work with SMS/MMS notifications.

1) Uncheck/deselect the "Set as default messaging client" option in the Zlango Messaging settings/preferences. If this option is checked/selected then Droid Notify may not work (i.e. SMS/MMS notifications may not be displayed).

==Will email notifications be an added feature in Droid Notify?==

The answer is...it depends...(possibly).

At this time the Email content on Android phones is secure and 3rd party apps cannot read the phones emails. The only solution to this is to develop an email client which is out of the scope of this project.

I will look into the Gmail api and see if we can read Gmail email as an alternative.

K-9 and Kaiten email clients are now supported but you will need to have a K-9 mail client (K-9 Mail, Kaiten, etc.) on your phone for those notifications to work. 

==Will Droid Notify display calendar events by non Android calendars?==

The answer is...it depends.

Developer apps have the ability to read the Google Calendar that is build into the Android OS. If the calendar app syncs all the information to the Google Calendar, then Droid Notify will read the Google Calendar and notify you of the events. On the other hand if the calendar app keeps it's own calendar, then developer apps can't access that data and so Droid Notify won't notify you of the calendar events.

==I get status bar notifications but no popup, why?==

This issue is most likely due to the popup being blocked. Being in a phone call blocks the popup, but there is also an option to block the popup if you are composing a message in a messaging app. You can change this setting here (Settings->Notification Settings->SMS/MMS/Missed Call/Calendar Notifications, Etc.->Blocking Notification Options). Select the option "Show Notification". This will ensure that the popup is not blocked.

==Can I help translate this application?==

Yes! I would encourage anyone who speaks English and any other language to help translate this application. Currently, I am trying out a collaborative translation tool powered by Translations powered by [http://www.crowdin.net/ CrowdIn.Net]. Email me if you would like to help translate this application (droidnotify@gmail.com).

==The SMS timestamp is not correct. What can I do?==

This is a problem because depending on the cell carrier, SMS messages will be delivered with a timestamp in either UTC time or in local time. By default, the app expects the incoming timestamp to be in local time.
 

There are two ways to correct his. 

 
1) Tell the app that the incoming SMS messages are in UTC time and not local time. Settings->Notification Settings->SMS Settings->Time Is In UTC....Check this box to tell the app that incoming SMS timestamps are in UTC.

2) Manually adjust the time via an Advanced Sertting. Settings->Advanced Settings->SMS Timeout Adjustment...Set the adjustment time here.

==Known Issues With Phones Running HTC Sense UI==

HTC has built on top of the stock Android OS a custom UI called Sense UI. Almost all HRC Android devices run this custom UI. Here are some known issue with this OS and Droid Notify:


1) SMS Unread Count not updating. Unfortunately, Sense UI does not have a way for 3rd party apps to refresh the counter so when Droid Notify updates the SMS data, the counter is not aware of it. Until they provide a way for 3rd party apps to refresh this icon, this will remain an issue on those devices.

==Known Issues With Phones Running Samsung Touchwiz UI==

Samsung has built on top of the stock Android OS a custom UI called Touchwiz. Almost all Samsung Android devices run this custom UI. Here are some known issue with this OS and Droid Notify:


1) SMS Unread Count not updating. Unfortunately, Samsung Touchwiz does not have a way for 3rd party apps to refresh the counter so when Droid Notify updates the SMS data, the counter is not aware of it. Until they provide a way for 3rd party apps to refresh this icon, this will remain an issue on those devices.

==Can Droid Notify Popups Display Over The Lock Screen?==

The answer is...it depends.

If you are using the stock Android OS lock screen, the answer is no. It is not possible to display information over the lock screen. If you are using a 3rd party lockscreen app, then the answer is yes (with conditions...you cannot be in security mode).

Here is why: Unfortunately, apps cannot be displayed over lock screens. This is a common misconception among Android users. Android has a built in lock screen and it's not possible to keep the phone locked while displaying information over it. With Android you can unlock or lock the phone, there is no state which is locked, but displaying information on the screen like a popup. There are 3rd party apps which are lock screen replacements but they are apps and are NOT part of the Android OS. When they are running, they DO NOT lock your phone, they are an app that is faking the process. Displaying information over a 3rd party lock screen occurs because your phone is never locked. Displaying an app over another app is perfectly normal and that is what you see when you see a popup over a 3rd party lock screen app.

==K-9 Emails are not being shown. Why?==

There is most likely one of two reasons that this might happen.

1) The most likely reason is that you installed K-9 or Kaiten AFTER you installed Droid Notify. The reason has to do with permissions. Basically, K-9/Kaiten define permisoins that Droid Notify uses. If you install Droid Notify first, the permisions are not associated with the app and it will break. All you have to do is uninstall Droid Notify and re-install it again.

2) The less likely reason is that there is a bug in the code. Try step 1 first and if that doesn't solve the problem please send me an email with a debug log.

==The LED light is not working. Why?==

The Android OS allows you to set the LED color to any color that you want, after which the hardware will *do its best* to show that color. If the color you chose doesn't show properly or doesn't show at all then it is likely a hardware limitation. Some newer Android phones may not even have an LED or may not have an LED that supports multiple colors (or the color that you selected). 

In my experience, many phones only show the LED when the screen is off. If the option to unlock the phone and turn the screen on is selected, then the LED will never be displayed on these phones. Another problem is that some phones only display a few colors (red, green, orange). If you set the LED color to blue or a bluish color, for example, then the LED will not be shown at all.

==Known Issues==

Here are confirmed, known issues that have not been resolved yet:
  * *Screen doesn't turn on / screen flashes when new notifications arrive.* I have seen this on some devices (but not all). Due to Android fragmentation and the shear number of different hardware devices and rooted/ROM phones, it's difficult to find a cause for this problem but I will continue to try to update the waking of the phone to make it as smooth as possible for as many phones/makes/models as possible.
